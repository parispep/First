                <h2> My Favorite Eatries while growing up!</h2>
            </div>
            <p> Growing up in the city of Abuja, Area 3 Garki to be precise, my favorite restuarant
                was <strong>Killimanjaro</strong>.
                I had acollection of delicacies that i would die for anyday and anytime, before school and after
                school.
                Unfortunately for me, I atteneded a boarding school and i didnt have the luxry to eat at
                <strong>Kilimanjaro</strong> all
                the time that I craved for one of their delicacies.
            </p>
            <p>Another very good eatery as at then was <b>Mr Biggs</b>, everybody loved Mr Biggs and their chicken
                and
                meatpie was
                to die for. They had the best meat pie fillings then infact, arguably one can say that they have the
                best
                meat pie fillings in the entire Nigeria unlike the potatoes pie and flour pie that we have now in
                the
                country.</p>
            <p>How would i ever forget <b>KingFisher</b>, they had the best ranges of snacks in the entire Nigeia.
                the Fishroll,Chicken pie, Scotch egg, Rolling snacks and what have you. Everry rich kid must drop by at
                KingFisherbefore going to schoo,lets say, you must decide if you will go to school or eat grab a pie at
                kingfisher.
            </p>
            <p> And again one must add <b>Tantalizer</b> to the list, lol! ofcourse every adult then during the
                valentines
                period,
                must take their lovers to the <b> Tantalizer</b> spot. As a matter of fact, they had hideouts and
                fancy
                spots where
                lovers and aspiring lovers can cave a niche for themselves when they patronize them.
                <b>Tantalizer</b>was a
                big
                name then. If your supossed lover has not taken you there, then he is either broke or you are
                suposedly
                not
                his real girlfriend. Please domt ask me how i knew all these at my tender age becuase i had aunts
                that
                happened to be the happening babes or hot babes in town as of then and men were aLways flocking
                around
                them
                so, gist were always flying around for me to eavesdrop
            </p>
            <p>An yes my <b>Drumsticks</b>, they had one of the best chicken garnishing then before the likes of KFC
                and
                CHICJEN
                REPUBLIC emerged and seenm to have thrown them out of the market and these really hurts becuase,
                seeing
                them
                takes me down to the memory lane and the nostalgic feelings that i get each time that i see them,
                makes
                me
                to crave for them and even more. But not to worry so much as the new generation eatries seem to not
                be
                doing
                so bad even though the economic downtime of the country is biting so hard and one could only imagine
                for
                how
                long that they will be able to stay in bussiness due to the persistent and creeping inflation. </p>
            <p> The great<b>"MACDONALDS"</b> I used the great due to the fact that they were actualy great.
                Macdonalds
                had
                the
                best Donoughts and other specialties but i would mostly tag them kings of tasty and creamy donughts
                becuase
                up till this very moment, no new eatry or restauranrt has been able to over throw them in that
                business
                and
                i miss them so much. You must be wondering why they stayed out in Nigeria, well after they got
                missed up
                with a little scandal in regards to their production process, their business in NIGERIA started
                fizzling
                out
                gradually.</p>
            <p><b>Genesis</b> had varieties of packages to present to the users becuase ranging from delicious
                buffet
                kind
                of
                seetings to cinema movies, they were competing with silver bird as at then. lets us stick with they
                menus
                becuase afterall, that is what this topic is talking about. Genesis had one of the best rice
                varieties
                and
                they all taste so greta and sumptous. Also, they have their pizza that drives me crazy and one could
                hardly
                choose their pizza and that of Pepperoni but then and then, they taste unique and i never preffered
                one
                over
                the other as the choice goes with the mood that i was at then.<br> Due to my love for food and
                snacks,I
                then decided to learn how to bake my own <em>Scotch egg</em> in the <b> Kilimanjaro</b> way but
                before i
                teach you that, let me list my top most preffered meals in all these etaries that i have mentioned
                above
            </p>
